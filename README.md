# Face-Detection---OpenCV-and-Keras
The World Health Organization (WHO) reports suggest that the two main routes of transmission of the COVID-19 virus are respiratory droplets and physical contact.

Respiratory droplets are generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Any person in close
contact (within 1 m) with someone who has respiratory symptoms (coughing, sneezing) is at risk of
being exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets.

Droplets may also land on surfaces where the virus could remain viable; thus, the immediate
environment of an infected individual can serve as a source of transmission (contact transmission).
Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain
respiratory viral diseases, including COVID-19.

We wish to apply a Machine Learning algorithm to create a model which will determine the
presence of a mask. This project can be used in various places as it is now mandatory to wear masks
in public places.

In our project, medical masks are defined as surgical or procedure masks that are flat or pleated (some
are shaped like cups); they are affixed to the head with straps. The project will use a set of video
streams/images to identify people who are compliant with the government rule of wearing medical
masks.

*This could help the government to take appropriate action against people who are non-compliant.*
